# To do

Short term build:

One page app which when opened generates list of awesome undiscovered songs from Youtube and Soundcloud. Will keep playing after you click. Allow you to queue songs and star them to local storage. 

Filter
- determine like/dislike and like/view parameters for best results programmatically for each source.
- generate dictionary of popular artists from last.fm
- check for popular duplicate/re upload
- fix duplicates from showing up in same list

Song Finder
- Make sure each song has shareable URL

Play queue 
- behaviour for playing songs within the queue is a little funky.

Player
- Make playback quicker, Preload first song, Preload next song 
- On hover start buffering song in secondary player
- work out how to dynamically add and remove players
- add loading/buffering state to player
- add volume setting to player, media players
- make player work without flash
- show youtube player for youtube songs

- take thumbnail into consideration?
