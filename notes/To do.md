# To do

Short term build:
One page app which when opened generates radio of awesome undiscovered songs from Youtube and Soundcloud. 

Has options to pick a genre and perhaps view count.

Save songs to local storage.
Add song to play queue.
Like/Skip song.
Remove song from list.
Share playlist.
Share song feature.
Load more results
Regenerates next results on like


handle timeouts and errors from youtube
think about structuring the app so that we're not just dealing with youtube videos

Long term:

create crud app
   with users
   to save songs
   make playlists

   cache youtube search responses?
   provide only whitelisted response to unlogged in users

   we'll need to go way deeper into their results at some point
